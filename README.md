# Stellar BatchPay

## What Is This?

Stellar BatchPay is a toolkit for sending many transfers on Stellar in two ways:

- **Batch Payments**: immediate transfers sent in efficient transaction batches.
- **Batch Vesting**: time-locked allocations deposited once and claimable later.

Think of it like this: if you need to process payouts for hundreds of recipients, you can either pay them now (batch payments) or lock funds until a future date (batch vesting), all from one project.

## Core Features

- **Immediate batch payouts** for payroll, vendor settlements, rewards, and mass distributions.
- **Time-locked batch vesting** for grants, milestone payouts, token unlock schedules, and delayed compensation.
- **CSV/JSON friendly workflow** for upload, validation, and processing.
- **Stellar-aware batching** that respects network operation limits.
- **Detailed result visibility** for processed transactions and recipient-level outcomes.

## The Problem It Solves

**Without this tool:**
- You'd need to manually send each payment individually
- You'd have to sign each transaction separately
- Processing hundreds of payments would take hours or days
- You'd be prone to making mistakes with manual entry

**With Stellar BatchPay:**
- Upload a list of payments (in CSV or JSON format)
- The system automatically groups them into efficient batches
- All payments are signed and sent in seconds
- You get a detailed report showing exactly what succeeded and what failed

For teams that need delayed distribution, the project also supports **batch vesting** so funds can be allocated now and unlocked at a specific future time.

---

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **You prepare a list** of who gets paid and how much
2. **You upload the file** to the web interface or use the command-line tool
3. **The system validates** everything is correct
4. **It automatically groups payments** into batches (Stellar limits how many per transaction)
5. **All payments are signed and submitted** to the Stellar blockchain
6. **You get a report** showing exactly what happened

For vesting flows, the sender deposits funds for many recipients with a shared unlock time, and recipients claim once the lock expires.

---

## How It Works (Technical Version)

The system has three main parts:

### 1. Core Library (`lib/stellar/`)
The "engine" that does all the work:
- **Reads your payment files** (JSON or CSV)
- **Checks everything is valid** (correct addresses, valid amounts, etc.)
- **Groups payments into batches** following Stellar's rules (max 100 operations per transaction)
- **Builds the transactions** and signs them with your Stellar account
- **Submits to Stellar** and gets back results

### 2. Web Interface (`app/` and `components/`)
A browser-based tool where you can:
- Upload a CSV or JSON file with your payment list
- See a preview of what will be sent (addresses, amounts, asset types)
- Choose whether to use testnet (practice) or mainnet (real money)
- Click a button to send everything
- See detailed results including transaction IDs

### 3. Command-Line Tool (`cli/`)
For developers and automated systems:
- Run commands from your terminal
- Automate bulk payments in scripts
- Integrate with other systems
- Useful for technical users and systems integration

### 4. Batch Vesting Contract (`contracts/batch-vesting/`)
A Soroban smart contract for time-locked distribution:
- **`deposit(...)`** stores vesting records for multiple recipients in one call
- Accepts a common **`unlock_time`** for the batch
- Enforces **`MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 100`** for both deposits and batch revocations
- Transfers total tokens from sender to the contract at deposit time
- **`claim(...)`** lets each recipient withdraw only after unlock time

## Getting Started (Non-Technical Users)

### What You Need
- A Stellar account (like a digital wallet)
- The secret key for your account (keep this private!)
- A list of people to pay and amounts (as a CSV or JSON file)
- Enough money in your account for all the payments

### Quick Steps

1. **Start the application:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

2. **Prepare your payment file** (see examples below)

3. **Click "Choose File"** and upload your payment list

4. **Review the preview** to make sure everything looks correct

5. **Select testnet (to practice) or mainnet (real payments)**

6. **Click "Submit Batch"** and wait for it to process

7. **Check the results** to see what succeeded and failed

> Note: The current web flow is focused on direct batch payments. Batch vesting is implemented in the smart contract layer and can be integrated into app/automation workflows as needed.

## Payment File Formats

### CSV Format (Easiest for Spreadsheets)

```csv
address,amount,asset
GBBD47UZM2HN7D7XZIZVG4KVAUC36THN5BES6RMNNOK5TUNXAUCVMAKER,10.50,XLM
GBJCHUKZMTFSLOMNC7P4TS4VJJBTCYL3AEYZ7R37ZJNHYQM7MDEBC67,25.00,XLM
GDZST3XVCDTUJ76ZAV2HA72KYXP7NQJLX7NBXGQVVFEWZYZK7WPVNKYA,100.00,USDC:GBUQWP3BOUZX34ULNQG23RQ6F4BWFIDBPPK7B7ILALX7DNZY5GJUSYM
```

**Columns:**
- **address**: The Stellar wallet address of the person getting paid (always starts with 'G')
- **amount**: How much to send (can have decimals like 10.50)
- **asset**: What type of money to send
  - `XLM` for regular Stellar lumens
  - `ASSETNAME:ISSUER` for other assets (like `USDC:GBUQWP3BOUZX34ULNQG23RQ6F4BWFIDBPPK7B7ILALX7DNZY5GJUSYM`)

### JSON Format (For Programmers)

```json
[
  {
    "address": "GBBD47UZM2HN7D7XZIZVG4KVAUC36THN5BES6RMNNOK5TUNXAUCVMAKER",
    "amount": "10.50",
    "asset": "XLM"
  },
  {
    "address": "GBJCHUKZMTFSLOMNC7P4TS4VJJBTCYL3AEYZ7R37ZJNHYQM7MDEBC67",
    "amount": "25.00",
    "asset": "XLM"
  },
  {
    "address": "GDZST3XVCDTUJ76ZAV2HA72KYXP7NQJLX7NBXGQVVFEWZYZK7WPVNKYA",
    "amount": "100.00",
    "asset": "USDC:GBUQWP3BOUZX34ULNQG23RQ6F4BWFIDBPPK7B7ILALX7DNZY5GJUSYM"
  }
]
```

## Batch Vesting

Batch vesting is for **time-locked payments**. Instead of transferring funds to recipients immediately, you deposit tokens into a vesting contract now, set an unlock timestamp, and recipients claim later.

### How Time-Locked Payments Work

1. **Sender deposits** tokens for many recipients in one contract call.
2. Each recipient gets a vesting record with `amount` and `unlock_time`.
3. Funds remain locked in the contract until unlock time is reached.
4. Recipient calls `claim` to receive funds after unlock time.

### Good Use Cases

- **Payroll with cliff dates** (payday unlocks).
- **Contributor or community grants** with delayed release.
- **Milestone-based payouts** that should only unlock after agreed dates.
- **Token distribution schedules** where immediate liquidity is not desired.

### Payments vs Vesting (At a Glance)

| Capability | Batch Payments | Batch Vesting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When recipient gets funds | Immediately after tx confirmation | After `unlock_time` and claim |
| Main primitive | Stellar payment operations | Soroban vesting contract storage + claim |
| Typical use | Operational payouts | Grants, cliffs, milestone unlocks |
| Custody before recipient receives | Sender until sent | Contract escrow until unlock |

### Contract Interface (Current Implementation)

Implemented in `contracts/batch-vesting/src/lib.rs`:

- `deposit(env, sender, token, recipients, amounts, unlock_time)`
- `batch_revoke(env, caller, recipients, token, unlock_time)`
- `claim(env, recipient, token)`

`deposit` validates recipient/amount arrays, rejects batches larger than 100 entries, stores per-recipient vesting state, and transfers total token amount into contract custody. `batch_revoke` applies the same 100-recipient limit so oversized revocation calls fail before doing per-recipient work. `claim` enforces the lock and transfers vested funds to the recipient.

## Important Things to Know

### Testnet vs Mainnet
- **Testnet**: Practice mode. Money isn't real, useful for testing before sending real money.
- **Mainnet**: Real money. Only use this when you're sure everything is correct.

### Costs
Each transaction costs a small fee (about 0.00001 XLM per operation). The system automatically calculates and deducts these fees.

### Limits
- Maximum 100 payments per transaction (the system automatically splits larger batches)
- Maximum 100 vesting recipients per `deposit` or `batch_revoke` call
- You can't undo a payment once submitted
- You need enough money in your account for all payments plus fees
- For vesting, recipients cannot claim before unlock time

### Safety
- **Never share your secret key** with anyone
- Always test with testnet first
- Double-check addresses before sending real money
- The system validates everything before sending

## Real-World Example

Let's say you need to pay 250 influencers for promoting your product:

1. **Prepare a CSV file** with all 250 addresses and amounts
2. **Upload to the web interface**
3. **System automatically creates 3 transactions** (250 payments ÷ 100 max per transaction = 3 batches)
4. **All 3 are signed and submitted** in seconds
5. **You get a report** showing all 250 payments with their status

Without this tool, you'd be manually sending payments for hours. With it? Done in seconds.

### Vesting Example

You need to allocate milestone grants to 40 builders, but unlock only at quarter end:

1. Deposit all 40 allocations to the batch vesting contract with a shared unlock timestamp
2. Contract escrows total tokens immediately
3. Each builder claims after the unlock date
4. No manual release run is needed at unlock time

import { validatePaymentInstructions } from '@/lib/stellar';

const errors = validatePaymentInstructions(paymentList);
if (errors.length > 0) {
  console.log('Problems found:', errors);
}
```

**Parse files:**
```typescript
import { parseInput } from '@/lib/stellar';

const payments = await parseInput(fileContent, 'csv');
```

**Submit batch (server-side only):**
```typescript
import { StellarService } from '@/lib/stellar/server';

const service = new StellarService({
  secretKey: process.env.STELLAR_SECRET_KEY,
  network: 'testnet'
});

const results = await service.submitBatch(payments);
```

## What Information You Get Back

After submitting, you'll see:

- **Total recipients processed**: How many people got paid
- **Total amount sent**: Combined value of all payments
- **Number of transactions**: How many blockchain transactions were used
- **Per-recipient status**: For each person, did they get paid or was there an error?
- **Transaction IDs**: The blockchain reference for each transaction (so you can verify on a blockchain explorer)
- **Timestamp**: When everything was processed

For vesting workflows, you should also track contract-level events/state such as deposit execution, recipient vesting records, unlock timestamp, and successful claims.

---

## Common Questions

**Q: What if one payment fails?**
A: The system tries to include failed payments in the next batch automatically. You'll see in the results which ones failed and why.

**Q: Can I cancel payments?**
A: No, once submitted to the blockchain, payments can't be undone. This is why testnet exists — test first!

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: Usually 3-5 seconds per transaction. So 250 payments would take about 10-15 seconds.

**Q: What if my payment file has 500 recipients?**
A: The system automatically splits it into 5 transactions (500 ÷ 100) and processes them all.

**Q: Can I use different types of money?**
A: Yes! In the same batch, you can send some people XLM, others USDC, others any asset on Stellar.

**Q: Is this secure?**
A: Your secret key never leaves your computer/browser. All processing happens locally or on your own server.
